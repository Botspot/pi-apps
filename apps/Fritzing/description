The Fritzing application is an Electronic Design Automation software with a low entry barrier, suited for the needs of makers and hobbyists.
It offers a unique real-life "breadboard" view, and a parts library with many commonly used high-level components. Fritzing makes it very easy to communicate about circuits, as well as to turn them into PCB layouts ready for production. 

To run: Menu -> Programming/Development -> Fritzing
