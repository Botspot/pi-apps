Lunar Client is an all-in-one modpack integrated Launcher available for ONLY popular versions of Minecraft 

This installs a fork of Lunar Client with patched dependencies for ARMhf/ARM64 support.

To run: Menu -> Games -> Lunar Client
To run in a terminal: ~/.local/bin/lunarclient.AppImage --no-sandbox

NOTE: For best performance, we recommend an older version of Minecraft like 1.12.2 or 1.8

Why lunar?
- It's easy to use and to setup.
- It supports Microsoft and Mojang accounts.
- This fork of Lunar for ARM automatically switches lwjgl2/3 libraries (for playing older versions)
- It's easy to install in a self contained AppImage.
