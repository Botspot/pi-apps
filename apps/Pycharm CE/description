Python IDE for Professional and Educational Developers.

PyCharm is now one powerful, unified product! Its core functionality, including Jupyter Notebook support, will be free, and a Pro subscription will be available with additional features. Starting with the 2025.1 release, every user will get instant access to a free one-month Pro trial, so you’ll be able to access all of PyCharm’s advanced features right away. After the trial, you can choose whether to continue with a Pro subscription or keep using the core features for free.

Previously, PyCharm was offered as two separate products: the free Community Edition (which was used in Pi-Apps) and the Professional Edition with extended capabilities. Now, with a single streamlined product, you no longer need to choose. Everything is in one place, and you can seamlessly switch between core and advanced features within the same installation whenever you need to.

You must configure the IDE to run each script ("py" file), or create a new environment.
For Educational purposes, the "EDUtools" plugin can be installed. Go to the right corner from the Pycharm start up portal: Configurate > Plugins > Search for: EDUtools > Install it and restart the IDE. Then you will able to select "Learn and Teach" for courses.

WARNING for all 32-bit OS users: All JetBrains applications are deprecated on 32-bit OS. Move to a 64-bit OS to be able to use the latest version.

To run: Menu -> Programming -> Pycharm
