Forge is a "Rules Engine" for the most popular card game Magic: the Gathering.

Forge creates a unique experience by combining an enormous card library with some RPG elements in Quest mode (comparable to the 'Shandalar', the late 90's PC Game) and Planar Conquest on the mobile version. 
Forge also includes a Graphical Map Based game mode called "Adventure Mode", which is more akin to 'Shandalar.' (Only in Mobile UI version)
