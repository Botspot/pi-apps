Website description:

Ready to use

Out-of-the-box access to more than 1,300 REAPER resource packages including scripts, effects, extensions, themes and language packs.

Extendable

Add more content to ReaPack by importing third-party repositories. A list of known repositories is maintained on this page.

Automatic updates

Browse through the package list and pick what you need. Keep all installed packages up-to-date with one click or enable a setting to mass install every present and future packages.

Free software

Free to use and open-source. ReaPack is decentralized by design: it can operate independently of any single entity or package source.

Offline use

The studio computer is not connected to internet? Export installed packages into an archive file and import them on an offline computer.

Beta-test mode

By default ReaPack displays stable releases only. Pre-releases can be installed in an opt-in fashion either per-package or globally.
For users

Using REAPER scripts does not require programming skills. Many package developers supply documentation that can be consulted within ReaPack.
