Run x86 Windows apps with a box86-emulated version of x86 wine.
To run: wine path/to/file.exe
To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
Not all Windows applications will work under WINE. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if WINE needs some setting changes to get it to work.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
