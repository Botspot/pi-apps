Friday Night Funkin’ is a musical rhythm game where you compete in freestyle music battles.
The father of your girlfriend is always a pain, because no matter what you do, you may never be good enough for his daughter. In Friday Night Funkin, you are the "Boyfriend", and this cliché comes together in a colorful and musical mash. The fun of Friday and the stress of meeting your significant other's father will make your knees shake and your heart tingle.
