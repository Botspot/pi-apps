Minecraft Java - now supports Microsoft accounts and Optifine!

This installs a fork of Lunar Client, with built in Optifine and other mods for maximum out-of-the-box performance.

To run: Menu -> Games -> Minecraft Launcher
To run in a terminal: ~/lunarassets/lunarclient.AppImage

NOTE: For best performance (60 FPS+), we recommend an older version of Minecraft like 1.12.2 or 1.8

Why lunar?
- It's easy to use and to setup.
- It is well-maintained and has a vibrant support community.
- It supports Microsoft and Mojang accounts.
- This fork of Lunar for ARM includes Optifine, automatically switches lwjgl libraries (for playing older versions), and includes other optimizations by default.
- It's easy to install in a self contained AppImage.
