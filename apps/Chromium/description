Open-source version of Google Chrome.
If you are using Raspberry Pi OS, this browser has been optimized by the Raspberry Pi Foundation to include hardware acceleration and other various performance improvements.

To play Netflix, Spotify, or other protected multimedia streams, see the Chromium Widevine app.
To install an older version of Chromium, see the Downgrade Chromium app.

Chromium supports numerous flags to enable extra features. You can add these flags either manually (by running chromium-browser in a terminal), or by adding the flag to a file in the /etc/chromium/customizations folder.
Here's how that works: Inside the /etc/chromium/customizations folder there will be one or more files. On most systems there will already be a 00-rpi-vars file there. You can add flags to it, or create a new file. In all cases, be sure it starts with:
CHROMIUM_FLAGS="${CHROMIUM_FLAGS}
And be sure it ends with this character: "

Now that you know how to add flags to Chromium, here are some useful ones:
- Enable Google Chrome Sync: --oauth2-client-id=77185425430.apps.googleusercontent.com --oauth2-client-secret=OTJgUOQcT7lO7GsGZq2G4IlT
    This flag is discussed in the Raspberry Pi Forums: https://forums.raspberrypi.com/viewtopic.php?t=314477
- Enable dark mode: --force-dark-mode
    If you want more themes, go visit the Chrome Web Store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/themes
- Change the scale of the browser window: --force-device-scale-factor=1.3
    The default is 1 - smaller values will shrink the interface, while larger values will grow the interface.
