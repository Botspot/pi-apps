Web-app for Zoom
This is basically a web browser running Zoom's new Progressive Web App. Performance is better in some ways and worse in others.
This app should be considered a backup option, only used if the regular Zoom app doesn't work at all.
Both versions can be installed at the same time and will not interfere with each another.

Note: this app requires you to have chromium-browser, chromium, or google-chrome installed. Let us know if your Chromium-based browser is not detected by the script.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Zoom PWA
To run in a terminal: cat ~/.local/share/applications/chrome-gbmplfifepjenigdepeahbecfkcalfhg-Zoom-PWA.desktop | grep Exec | sed 's/Exec=//g' | bash
