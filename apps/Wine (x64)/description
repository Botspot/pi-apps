Run x64 Windows apps with a box64 version of x64 wine-8.11.
To run: wine path/to/file.exe
To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.

NOTE: x86 32bit applications currently do not work as Box64 needs many changes to support the new Wine WOW64 mode.
If you see a warning in the terminal log containing experimental wow64 mode, your application contains 32bit binaries and will not work currently.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
