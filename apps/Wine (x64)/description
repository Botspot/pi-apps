Run x86 and x64 Windows apps with a box64-emulated version x86/x64 wine-8.11 (WOW64 mode enabled).
To run: wine path/to/file.exe
To configure wine: go to 'Wine configuration' in main menu or type in terminal: wine winecfg
Not all Windows applications will work under Wine. It's a good idea to check online if your program can run, or if something can be tweaked to make it work.

Note: x86 32bit applications use the new Wine WOW64 mode. The WOW64 mode allows for running x86 Windows applications on x86_64 without any x86 Linux userspace.
Note: This mode is experimental in Wine and Box64 support for x86 code still need some work. However, many applications already work.

Note: the applications installed with wine will appear under the wine category in the main menu, and they will stay there even after uninstalling wine.
