Newest version of a popular video editor, compatible with PiOS Bookworm
Most Linux video editors have issues on Wayland, including the default (old) version of Kdenlive available with sudo apt install.
This version is straight from flatpak, and is kept quite up to date.

To run: Menu -> Sound & Video -> Kdenlive
To run in a terminal: flatpak run --file-forwarding org.kde.kdenlive
