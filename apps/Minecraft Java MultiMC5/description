CUSTOM BUILD of MultiMC5/Launcher. MultiMC is an alternative launcher for Minecraft. It allows you to have multiple, cleanly separated instances of Minecraft (each with their own mods, resource packs, saves, etc) and helps you manage them and their associated options with a simple and powerful interface. 

Features of the launcher:
- Microsoft, Mojang, and PC GamePass Account support
- Modrinth FTB ATLauncher and Technic Modpack ONLY installation
- Automatic Java 8/17 installation
- Fabric, Forge, and Quilt mod loading
- Supports minecraft versions from the old beta/alphas all the way up the latest snapshots

Features NOT in this launcher (but available in others):
- Mod installation
- Curseforge Modpack installation
- Mod/Modpack updating
- Old Snapshots

NOTE: The use of performance enhancing mods is highly encouraged, such as optifine with Optifabric and Fabric/Forge or Sodium/Lithium/Starlight Fabric Mods.
