XMRig is a RandomX, KawPow, CryptoNight, AstroBWT and GhostRider unified CPU/GPU cryptominer and RandomX benchmark

See the website for more information.

If you need an XMR wallet, go to https://wallet.mymonero.com/, create a wallet, and save the mnumonic somewhere safe. You will need the Wallet Address for Mining.

Running XMRig:

armhf:

If you didn't create a configuration file, or running the above doesn't work, you can enter the XMRig chroot manually, and run xmrig with the below: 

$ xmrig-chroot
Or
$ sudo chroot $HOME/xmrig/bullseye

If you don't have a configuration file:

$ xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10032 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

Or, if you did configure XMRig:
$ xmrig

arm64:

$ xmrig [options]

Have fun!
