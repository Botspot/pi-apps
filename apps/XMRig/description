If you need an XMR wallet, go to https://wallet.mymonero.com/, create a wallet, and save the mnumonic somewhere safe. You will need the Wallet Address for Mining.

To run in a terminal: xmrig
This is assuming you set up the config file. Otherwise, you can add flags like this: 
xmrig -o gulf.moneroocean.stream:10032 -u YOUR_WALLET_ADDRESS

If you use the MoneroOcean pool, you can view the miner's performance by visiting https://moneroocean.stream

NOTE:
This is not a Bitcoin miner! Most XMRig users mine Monero - a cryptocurrency with exceptional privacy, security, and decentralization measures.
Monero is probably the best currency for PC mining, as its mining algorithm is specifically designed to thwart specialized mining equipment.
