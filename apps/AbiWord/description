A free and open-source alternative to Microsoft Word.  

AbiWord is a lightweight word processor compatible with a wide variety of file formats. It doesn't have all the bells and whistles of Microsoft Word or Libre Office's Writer, but it is more than enough for the average user.
The source code is available at https://gitlab.gnome.org/World/AbiWord.

NOTE: AbiWord uses .abw extension by default.

To run: Menu -> Office -> Abiword.
To run in terminal:  abiword.
