Of course Pi-Apps lets you download more RAM!
This app sets up ZRAM and a swapfile.
ZRAM compresses the data stored in RAM, thereby increasing the capacity. Swap allows RAM to overflow to the disk, only if absolutely necessary.
These modifications prevent the system from locking up under heavy memory usage. Under low memory usage, neither ZRAM nor swap are used.

How much RAM do you get?
- ZRAM will double the total capacity available. (4GB of ZRAM on a 4GB Pi, 1GB on a 1GB Pi)
- Swap will add 1GB of overflow capacity. This will be skipped if your SD card is nearly full. (<2GB free space)
