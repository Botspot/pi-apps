The best vector graphics image editor for Raspberry Pi.
Finally, the full version of Boxy SVG has arrived! This installs the Boxy SVG offline Chrome App onto your existing Chromium Browser.
Performance is excellent, and I (Botspot) have been using it on my RPi for for all graphics editing. (Including the Pi-Apps logo!)

If you have a problem using Boxy SVG, please report it on Botspot's github page, not to the Boxy SVG website! If there's too many RPi-based bug reports, the Boxy SVG dev may withdraw his permission for it to be on Pi-Apps, and nobody wants that to happen.

Note: also see the Inkscape app.
