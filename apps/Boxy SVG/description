The best vector graphics image editor for Raspberry Pi.
This downloads Boxy SVG from Snap, but avoids using Snap to do so.
Performance is excellent, and I (Botspot) have been using it on my RPi for for all graphics editing. (Including the Pi-Apps logo!)

If you have a problem using Boxy SVG, please report it on Botspot's github page, not to the Boxy SVG website! If there's too many RPi-based bug reports, the Boxy SVG dev may withdraw his permission for it to be on Pi-Apps, and nobody wants that to happen.

Note: also see the Inkscape app.
