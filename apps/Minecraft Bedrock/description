Unofficial launcher for Minecraft Bedrock edition
NOTE: For better performance and smooth FPS, we recommend an older Bedrock version like 1.16.40 as it doesn't contain renderdragon or RTX code.

Run with the menu app "Minecraft Bedrock Launcher" or with the command "GALLIUM_HUD=simple,fps /opt/MCBedrock.AppImage"
