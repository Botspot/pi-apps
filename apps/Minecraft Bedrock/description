Unoffical launcher for Minecraft Bedrock edition
NOTE: For better performance and smooth FPS, we recommend an older Bedrock version like 1.16.40 as it doesn't contain renderdragon or RTX code.

Run with the menu app "Minecraft Bedrock Launcher" or with the command "GALLIUM_HUD=simple,fps /opt/MCBedrock.AppImage"
 ∙ Sign in with a Google Play account with Minecraft purchased
