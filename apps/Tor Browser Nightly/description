The Tor Browser is a free web browser built on Firefox that helps you surf the web anonymously by routing your connection through a secure, global network of volunteer servers. Your data is encrypted, and your IP address is hidden, protecting you from trackers, advertisers, and prying eyes. With built-in features like tracker blocking and script protection, Tor Browser ensures a safer online experience. Perfect for private browsing, accessing restricted sites, or exploring the web without leaving a trace.

Native aarch64 builds are coming! This is an official nightly aarch64 Linux build taken from https://nightlies.tbb.torproject.org/nightly-builds/tor-browser-builds/

WARNING! This is a build that is currently in development. It is mainly for testing purposes, you should expect bugs. However, this is better than 2 years old community build that is available in Pi Apps at this moment.

To run: Menu -> Internet -> Tor Browser Nightly
To run from terminal: `~/.local/share/tor-browser-nightly/start-tor-browser.desktop`

To remove user-data after uninstall use `rm -rf ~/.local/share/tor-browser-nightly`

You can transfer your user data (bookmarks, etc.) from a regular Tor installaion to this one manually. If you installed "Tor" from pi-apps, user data is located in "~/.local/share/tor-browser/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/" and you should copy it to "~/.local/share/tor-browser-nightly/Browser/TorBrowser/Data/Browser/"
