# vulkan does not work for some systems in SDL backend on Linux https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/pull/13054
# vulkan does not work at all in QT backend on Linux https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/11628
# QT backend does not work with wayland https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/16254
# GL cannot be used on QT backend on ARM32 due to QT5 being built with GLES and not GL on ARM32
# SDL is not guaranteed to have Wayland support builtin, so check for the headers before enabling it
# changing to vulkan in the UI does nothing and OpenGL continues to be used
# enabling it causes no compilation issues and it can not be fully disabled (always shows in the UI) so keep it enabled
# disable system FFMPEG as recommended by upstream (can be incompatible with some custom HW decoders and newew FFMPEG versions)
# bundled FFMPEG requires minimum GLIBC 2.28 and is available for armv7l and armv8
# architecture detection when kernel architecture does not match the userspace architecture is broken https://github.com/hrydgard/ppsspp/issues/18673
