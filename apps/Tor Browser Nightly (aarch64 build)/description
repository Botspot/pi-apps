The Tor Browser is a free web browser built on Firefox that helps you surf the web anonymously by routing your connection through a secure, global network of volunteer servers. Your data is encrypted, and your IP address is hidden, protecting you from trackers, advertisers, and prying eyes. With built-in features like tracker blocking and script protection, Tor Browser ensures a safer online experience. Perfect for private browsing, accessing restricted sites, or exploring the web without leaving a trace.
