Lokinet is a privacy focused network anyone can access using the latest in decentralized onion routing technology.

Lokinet requires no internet IP Address but instead provides it's own network addresses which can be either ephemeral, persistent or personalized depending on the users desired application. Information is onion routed through a globally distributed network of over one thousand nodes.

Hosting on Lokinet is quite easy and allows users to instantly create static addresses that can be privately accessed remotely over the internet for hosting their own online content. Using a Lokinet "SNApp" alleviates many of the challenges associated with hosting when it comes to configuring ports on a network. WIth SNApps there are no ports to forward. SNApps can be easily hosted on as little as an SBC inside a network and privately accessible anywhere in the world. SNApps also can hosted on a VPN using webservers such as Nginx, Apache, python etc. thereby allowing private anonymized global access your own personal content or sharing content privately among other users of the network. Web based applications such as IRC, Mumble, PeerTube, Pleroma, forums, streaming content etc. are all supportable through the network. The location and origin of the server is hidden and users anonymized while additionally the server can be secured in traditional ways. One can also register custom domains if they so choose to but this is not required to immediately generate a static address.

Users wishing to access the regular internet anonymously need not pay for access to use Lokinet but may chose to subscribe to an exit provider should they wish to enhance anonymous access the internet through such a provider. Additionally the network generally has free exit nodes available offered through individuals providing voluntary support to the network.

Currently the Oxen Privacy Tech Foundation offers free Lokinet exit node access at address "exit.loki". A wiki for Lokinet is located at https://wiki.oxen.io/wiki/Main_Page
