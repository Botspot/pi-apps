Notes:
To make a crafting table, press "E" and then go to the Craft menu in the upper left-hand corner. Click on what you want to craft, then click the big button with all of the stuff needed to craft the item to craft it.
Mouse scroll doesn't exist, you need to use your mouse to drag stuff like the crafting menu.
