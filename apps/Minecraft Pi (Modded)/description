A modded version of Minecraft: Pi Edition with things like survival mode, multiplayer support and more!

To open the launcher: Menu > Games > MCPIL. Use the launcher to set up mods and multiplayer.
NOTE: Make sure "GPU Driver" is set to Full/Fake in "raspi-config".

Need help? If it's related to an error or a bug, ask it on the Pi-Apps discord or open an issue on Pi-Apps.
But if it's related to using Minecraft Pi, then consider asking on MCPI's Discord server instead: https://discord.gg/3wXu3xtr
