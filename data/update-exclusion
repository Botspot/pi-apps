# This file contains files & directories that you don't want to be updated by the Pi-Apps updater script. Each line is run through grep -v, and the paths don't have to be absolute. 'icons/' is enough to exclude the pi-apps icons folder.

#icons/ # <-- uncomment to exclude the icons folder from being updated
