# A terrible idea that contradicts the very nature of Raspberry Pis.

## How to use my superior version of pi-apps:
1. Download sourcecode via browser or `git clone`
2. `cd` into directory
3. `chmod +x compile.sh`
4. `sh compile.sh`, `./compile.sh`, or `compile.sh`
5. Done! You now have access to a whole universe of software! This tool also **teaches** you *much more* about how to be resourceful and use Linux than the original pi-apps!!!

## If you don't know how to do any of these steps:
Look it up, you freaking pansy! If you really want to use the Pi for its intended purpose (a learning tool), THEN LEARN. Help yourself before you expect others to help you.
