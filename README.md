# A terrible idea that contradicts the very nature of Raspberry Pis.

## How to use my superior version of pi-apps:
1. Download sourcecode via browser or `git clone`
2. `cd` into directory
3. `chmod +x compile.sh`
4. `compile.sh`
5. Done! You now have access to a whole universe of software! This tool also **teaches** you *much more* about how to be resourceful and use Linux than the original pi-apps!!!
