## Introduction
Let's be honest: **Linux is harder to master than Windows.** Sometimes it's not user-friendly, and following an outdated tutorial may break your Raspberry Pi's operating system.  
There is no centralized software repository, except for the `apt` repositories which lack many desktop applications.  
Surely there is a better way! **There is.**  
Introducing Pi-Apps, an expanding, well-maintained collection of app installation-scripts that you can run with **one click**.  

To learn more:
- [ETA Prime's video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqNWJ52DLes) to install Minecraft with Pi-Apps. At the end, he says:
  > "It's an awesome Raspberry Pi app store and it works really well and there's lots of great stuff in here and it's super easy to install. I want to give the devs of Pi-Apps a big shout-out."
- [Pi-Apps walkthrough by leepspvideo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zxyWQ3FV98I). He said:
  > "Thanks so much to Botspot for creating this; it's a great program."

### Basic usage
- This is the **main window**.  
![main window](icons/screenshots/main%20window.png?raw=true)  
Use the main window to select an app category you want to view. Open a category folder by double-clicking on it.  
- After selecting a category, you will see a list of apps:  
![app list](icons/screenshots/app%20list.png?raw=true)  
- If you double-click an app, or select and app and click ![info.png](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/icons/info.png), you will see the **Details window**.  
![details](icons/screenshots/details%20window.png?raw=true)  
- Pi-Apps may display a notification on boot. If you choose to view the updates, the **updater window** will appear:

### Q&A with Botspot
 - Why did you develop Pi-Apps?  
> For a long time I have been saddened by how few people are aware of open-source RPi software projects. Many of these projects are extremely useful and beneficial, but there has never been a good way to distribute them.  
> The repositories don't host them, and they are rarely advertised well, so how will people find them?  
> Most people never find them.  
> One day I realized: Why not make an app store that specializes in all the community RPi software projects out there? It will help more users find the software, and at the same time it would provide a super simple way to install them.  
> (Which would you rather do - click an Install button, or copy-n-paste multiple commands from someone's blog?)

 - How long did it take to program this?  
> To lay the groundwork, it took two weeks of nearly non-stop coding. Since then, I've continually optimized performance, fixed bugs, added new features, and added numerous new apps.

 - Is Pi-Apps still under development?
> Sure is! We're always on the lookout for new app-suggestions, and solve app-installation issues by reading incoming bug reports.

 - Is Pi-Apps free?
> Absolutely!
