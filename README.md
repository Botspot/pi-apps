## Introduction
Let's be honest: **Linux is harder to master than Windows.** Sometimes it's not user-friendly, and following an outdated tutorial may break your Raspberry Pi's operating system.  
There is no centralized software repository, except for the `apt` repositories which lack many desktop applications.  
Surely there is a better way! **There is.**  
Introducing Pi-Apps, a well-maintained collection of app installation-scripts that you can run with **one click**.  

Pi-Apps now serves **over 1,000,000 people** and hosts [nearly 200 apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/wiki/Apps-List).

## Install Pi-Apps
Open a terminal and run this command:
```bash
wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Botspot/pi-apps/master/install | bash
```

- [Twister OS](https://twisteros.com/download.html): fully supported, preinstalled.
- Kali Linux, Ubuntu, Ubuntu Mate, any other Debian-based ARM OS: Pi-Apps should mostly work but you may encounter errors for some apps.

- This is the **details window**:  
![details](icons/screenshots/details%20window.png?raw=true)  
  - ![icon](icons/screenshots/buttons/back2.png?raw=true) Go back to the list of apps.

![settings](icons/screenshots/settings.png?raw=true)  
In addition to changeable settings, this window also gives access to these tools:
  - ![icon](icons/screenshots/buttons/categories.png?raw=true) Does that one app seem to be in the wrong category? With this button, you can change it.
  - ![icon](icons/screenshots/buttons/new%20app.png?raw=true) Create a new app with a wizard-style set of dialogs. We recommend reading [the tutorial](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/wiki/Creating-an-app).

- The easiest way to help is by "Starring" our repository - it helps more people find Pi-Apps. (Scroll to the top of this page and on the right there is a "Star" button)
- If you know somebody else who has a Raspberry Pi, feel free to tell them about Pi-Apps. We would offer you a referral discount, but Pi-Apps is free, so... `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`
- You can [make suggestions](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=suggestion.md), [report bugs](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=bug_report.md), or [suggest apps](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/issues/new?template=app-request.md).
- You can create and submit an app. Don't worry, it's about as easy as using the terminal! (And it's even easier if you're submitting a simple apt-package.)

### Q&A with Botspot
 - Why did you make Pi-Apps?  
> For a long time I have been saddened by how difficult it is to install software on Linux. In that regard, nearly all other operating systems put us to shame.  
> How will people discover useful, free software?  
> Most people **don't**.  
> One day I realized: Why not make a collection of scripts to install popular apps? This would save so much time, and makes it much easier to use a Raspberry Pi as a daily, desktop computer solution.  

 - How long did it take to program this?  
> Why would you think it's not still under development? 🤪  
> Pi-Apps took around 14 days to lay the groundwork, and ever since then it has been continually, and exponentially, improved. I (Botspot) am not the sole programmer anymore - [others](https://github.com/Botspot/pi-apps/graphs/contributors) have stepped in and made improvements too.

 - Is Pi-Apps free?
> Absolutely! In the future, I may allow donations, but Pi-Apps itself will always be free and open-source.
